"""
1ยบ  The sum of a and b ensures the final result is at least the larger of the two.
    abs(int(a) - int(b)) calculates the absolute difference between a and b.
    Dividing by 2 serves as a "rounding" mechanism to consider the absolute difference.

2ยบ  Calculates the largest between c and the previous value (ab). The logic resembles line 3.
